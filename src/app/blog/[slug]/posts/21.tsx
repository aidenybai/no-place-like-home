        i'm writing this as i'm coming back from an event at my old high school.
        being back there felt strange. teachers who once felt like authority
        figures now feel like peers. it made me realize something i've been
        circling around for a while: most adults are just big kids, and people
        change very slowly on the inside, even when they look or act different
        on the outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        for most of my life, my age has been deeply tied to my identity. when i
        started my company with fireship, when i built million.js at 16, when i
        dropped out, i was always "the young person who did X." my age was part
        of the pitch, part of the brand, part of how i understood myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        i've strayed away from that in the last few years. but it still feels
        surreal to be 21.
      </p>

      <p>
        21 is supposed to be the age where you're in college, drinking legally,
        finding jobs. i'm doing none of those things in the traditional sense,
        and i think that's okay.
      </p>

      <p>
        what i am doing: i write a lot more now. i carry a notebook everywhere.
        i read occasionally, but when i do, i read voraciously, and it changes
        how i think. i'm more grateful for those who choose to love me, because
        i understand now how rare that is.
      </p>

      <p>i feel solace in my decisions.</p>

      <p>
        i find joy in tackling hard problems of all sorts. dare i say i've
        matured? i do things even when they suck. i'm more okay with conflict
        now. i can cut people off if they harm me. i have harder conversations.
      </p>

      <p>
        i still suck at giving gifts. and texting. those are on my list for 21.
      </p>

      <p>
        i used to have this deep existential fear of dying and growing up. it's
        still there, somewhere, but it's quieter now. maybe because i've
        accepted that growing up isn't about becoming someone else, it's about
        becoming more yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        i'm eternally grateful for the people who supported me, the places that
        shaped me, and the things that made me change for the better.
